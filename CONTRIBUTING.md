## Contribution types

We are open to any contribution : improving documentation, model implementations/corrections, new features, bugs fixing, optimization,...

### Bug Fixes:
1. If you find a bug please submit a GitHub issue.
  - Make sure the title explains the issue.
  - Describe your setup, what you are trying to do, expected vs. actual behaviour. Please add configs and code samples.
  - Add details on how to reproduce the issue - a minimal test case is always best, colab is also great. Note, that the sample code shall be minimal and if needed with publicly available data.
2. Try to fix it or recommend a solution.
   - Convert your minimal code example to a unit/integration test with assert on expected results.
   - Start by debugging the issue.
   - Verify that your test case fails on the master branch and only passes with the fix applied.
3. Submit a PR!

### New Features:
1. Submit a GitHub issue - describe what is the motivation of such feature (adding the use case, or an example is helpful).
2. Determine the feature scope with us.
3. Submit a PR!

4. Add/update the relevant tests!

### Test cases:
To keep the project working as it should, we welcome any testing contribution to make sure that every bricks are working great together.
If you fall into an error that has not been yet covered by a test, it means that we needs your contribution.
